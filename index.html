<p>
I am a software developer with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I have experience working as a Software Engineer
for over 15 years. After taking some time to care for my children and work as a lay leader in the non-profit world,
I am returning to the workforce.  Because I have always liked analysis and working with data and databases,
data analytics is my new pursuit.  I am updating my programming and data skills by learning data analytics and
visualization at George Washington University’s bootcamp. I’d like to leverage my technical and leadership
experience while utilizing my data analytics skills to problem-solve, and ultimately attain a leadership
role in the IT industry.
</p>
<p>
My hobbies are learning programming languages online, reading, and walking my dog. I'm married with two daughters. I live
in Northern Virginia.
